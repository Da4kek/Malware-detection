# Malware Detection:

Malware detection involves using techniques and tools to identify, block, alert and respond to walware threats. Basic malware detection techniques can help idetify and restrict known threats and include **signature-based detection**, **checksumming**, and **application allowlisting**.   
Advanced malware detection techniques can help identify and restrict unknown threats and include **heuristic analysis**, **behavioral analysis**, and **machine learning**.

## Malware Detection Techniques:

#### Signature-based Detection:
* It uses the unique digital footprint, known as a signature, of software programs running on a protected system. Antivirus programs scan software, identifies their signature and compares it to signatures of known malware. 
* Signature-based detection is a style of detection that provides a mechanism for how the detector scans the data to find attacks. In this style of detection, unique identifiers are generated about a known attack so that any attack of that kind is rapidly dealt with.

In the technique, the detector flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. It is like blacklisting the attacks. It keeps a list of patterns that are not allowed and alerts if it sees something that matches the attacks in the list.  

#### Checksumming:
* This method is a type of signature analysis that involves calculating cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksums. It helps verify that files are uncorrupted.    
* Hackers often use polymorphic malicious advertisements to avoid detection by signature-based identification methods. In this case, the malware is modified slightly to change its signature. Checksumming can help identify these types of malware.
* When the security team identifies a malicious signature, the malware no longer contains the code fragment and cannot be found. The absence of a detectable signature in the variable code requires other malicious code detection techniques, such as:
  * Statistical analysis 
  * Cryptanalysis
  * Heuristics
  * Reduced masks
* The problem with signature-based malware detection is that it creates many false positives. Security experts rely on check summing-based tools to address this concern. 

#### Application Allowlisting:
* Application allowlists are the opposite of the attack signature approach. Instead of defining which software the antivirus program should block, it maintains a list of approved applications and blocks everything else. 
* It is quite common for legitimate applications to have security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware. Application allowlisting can help prevent these types of attacks.
* It works best with devices that strictly task-focused, such as web servers and IoT devices.

### Advanced Malware Detection Technologies:

Advanced solutions to defend against malware - endpoint protection platforms and endpoint detection and response solutions. These solutions use advanced malware detection techniques, such as:

#### Endpoint Protection Platforms :
 EPPs are deployed on endpoints such as employee workstations, servers and cloud-based resources. They serve as the first line of defense that can identify threats and block them before they cause damage to sensitive assets. 

 **Endpoint:** An endpoint is any device connected to your network, such as a laptop, phone, tablet, printer, server etc. Many organization has remote workers who access your system remotely through their endpoints. 

 *Techniques used in EPPs are:*
  * **Static analysis**: EPPs leverage tranditional static analysis methods to identify known malware strains and allow/deny applications flagged by admins.
  * **Behavioral analysis**: EPPs add behavioral analysis to detect unknwon threats or known malware that uses evasion tactics like mutation or encryption.
  * **Sandboxed inspection**: EPPs can run suspicious content in a sandbox, isolated from the main operating system. This makes it possible to "detonate" a file, observe its behavior and confirm if it is really malicious or not.
  * **Content Disarm and reconstruction (CDR)**: EPPs make it possible to remove malicious elements of legitimate content, and allow the user to access the content itself. CDR can remove the macro and allow the user to access the file, instead of blocking it entirely. 

#### Endpoint Detection and Response :
 EDR solutions complement EPP by allowing security teams to identify and respond the attacks on endpoint devices. If EPP failed to contain a threat, EDR makes it possible to

 *Techniques used in EPPs are:*
  * **Triage and investigate alerts**: EDR provides rich data from endpoints that allows security analysts to identify signs of an attack, and investigate them to confirm a security incident. 
  * **Threat hunting**: EDR makes it possible to proactively search endpoints and explore relevant data for signs of a breach.
