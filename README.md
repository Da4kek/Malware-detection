# Malware Detection:

Malware detection involves using techniques and tools to identify, block, alert and respond to walware threats. Basic malware detection techniques can help idetify and restrict known threats and include **signature-based detection**, **checksumming**, and **application allowlisting**.   
Advanced malware detection techniques can help identify and restrict unknown threats and include **heuristic analysis**, **behavioral analysis**, and **machine learning**.

## Malware Detection Techniques:

#### Signature-based Detection:
* It uses the unique digital footprint, known as a signature, of software programs running on a protected system. Antivirus programs scan software, identifies their signature and compares it to signatures of known malware. 
* Signature-based detection is a style of detection that provides a mechanism for how the detector scans the data to find attacks. In this style of detection, unique identifiers are generated about a known attack so that any attack of that kind is rapidly dealt with.
