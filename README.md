# Malware Detection:

Malware detection involves using techniques and tools to identify, block, alert and respond to walware threats. Basic malware detection techniques can help idetify and restrict known threats and include **signature-based detection**, **checksumming**, and **application allowlisting**.   
Advanced malware detection techniques can help identify and restrict unknown threats and include **heuristic analysis**, **behavioral analysis**, and **machine learning**.

## Malware Detection Techniques:

#### Signature-based Detection:
* It uses the unique digital footprint, known as a signature, of software programs running on a protected system. Antivirus programs scan software, identifies their signature and compares it to signatures of known malware. 
* Signature-based detection is a style of detection that provides a mechanism for how the detector scans the data to find attacks. In this style of detection, unique identifiers are generated about a known attack so that any attack of that kind is rapidly dealt with.

In the technique, the detector flags any activity that matches the structure of a known attack. It is like blacklisting the attacks. It keeps a list of patterns that are not allowed and alerts if it sees something that matches the attacks in the list.  

#### Checksumming:
* This method is a type of signature analysis that involves calculating cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksums. It helps verify that files are uncorrupted.    
* Hackers often use polymorphic malicious advertisements to avoid detection by signature-based identification methods. In this case, the malware is modified slightly to change its signature. Checksumming can help identify these types of malware.
* When the security team identifies a malicious signature, the malware no longer contains the code fragment and cannot be found. The absence of a detectable signature in the variable code requires other malicious code detection techniques, such as:
  * Statistical analysis 
  * Cryptanalysis
  * Heuristics
  * Reduced masks
* The problem with signature-based malware detection is that it creates many false positives. Security experts rely on check summing-based tools to address this concern. 

#### Application Allowlisting:
* Application allowlists are the opposite of the attack signature approach. Instead of defining which software the antivirus program should block, it maintains a list of approved applications and blocks everything else. 
* It is quite common for legitimate applications to have security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malware. Application allowlisting can help prevent these types of attacks.
* It works best with devices that strictly task-focused, such as web servers and IoT devices.
