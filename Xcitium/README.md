# OpenEDR Notes:

## Current cybersecurity landscape:

* Cybercriminals continue to act as sophisticated profit enterprises, operating in a highly organized manner and investing significant resources in research and development to further their capabilities.
  
* Digital treat activity is at an all-time high and the level of sophistication is increasing. The number of new malware variants increased by 88% in 2019, and the number of ransomware families increased by 18%.

**What is a data breach?**  
A data breach is a cyber attack in which sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected data has been accessed and/or disclosed in an unauthorized fashion. Data breaches may involve personal health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), trade secrets or intellectual property.

*CVE - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures*

## EDR fundamentals:
**What is EDR?**    
EDR stands for endpoint detection and response. It gives protection against cyber security attacks across various endpoint devices..
It investigates the entire lifecycle of the threat, providing insights into what happened, how it got in, where it has been and what needs to be done to remediate it.

*Endpoint*: The communication entry and exit point of an organization's network are what we call an endpoint. Endpoint refers to any device that is capable of connecting to a network. This includes desktops, laptops, mobile phones, tablets, servers, virtual environments, and IoT devices.    
*Detection*: Every EDR consists of a data exploration and threat hunting tool. As such, EDR would regularly scan for signs of any unusual activity in every endpoint device.    
*Response*: EDR is capable of responding to any threat that it detects. It can isolate the infected device from the network, terminate the malicious process, and even delete the malware.

**Anti-virus vs EDR**   
Anti-virus is designed to detect and block malware or a virus from establishing itself on a device before it accesses the network the user is connected to. However its limited capabilities are not enough to deal with more sophisticated threats.

EDR on the other hand, have many capabilities and antivirus is only one of those. Aside from having an antivirus tool, they are capable of providing a monitoring tool, threat intelligence database, and a cloud-based solution.
EDR solutions has multiple security layers that involve attack blocking, endpoint patching, firewall, whitelisting,blacklisting and next-generation antivirus.

EDR provides Network analysis, proactively hunt for potential threats, Detection, Containment, Investigation and Elimination of threats.
